    <h2 id="intro1">Intro</h2>
    <p> Minecraft is a blocky sandbox game where players explore a procedurally generated, three-dimensional world with virtually infinite terrain. Players can discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build structures, earthworks, and machines. The game is made up of blocks, creatures, and community. Players can choose to survive the night or build a work of art.</p>
    <h1 id="entities">Entities</h1>
    <p>In Minecraft, entities are living creatures that move around in the game. They have properties such as position, rotation, velocity, volume, and the ability to be on fire or have status effects. Some entities, like armor stands or paintings, are items with data tags that can be modified.</p>

    <h2 class="end-line" id="passive_1">Passive mobs</h2>
    <p class="background-blue">Unlike Neutral or Hostile mobs, passive mobs will never attack a player or another mob, even when they are attacked themselves. When under attack, a passive mob will typically try to run away from their attacker in a random direction. Examples of mobs with this behavior include Polar Bear cubs, Rabbits, and Horses.<br>Some mobs are always passive, regardless of which Game Mode is being played. However, all mobs, including some neutral and hostile mobs, become passive toward players when the difficulty is set to "peaceful", or when playing Creative mode; however, when the difficulty is set to "peaceful", most hostile mobs will not spawn. There will be an exception to neutral mobs, as they can still attack a player when provoked (Some examples are Wolves and Polar Bears), but they will deal no damage whatsoever, much like how a small slime attacks.</p>

    <h2 class="end-line" id="neutral_1">Neutral</h2>
    <p>Unlike Hostile or Passive mobs, neutral mobs will not attack a player or another mob unless the said mobs are provoked. When under attack, a neutral mob will turn to face their attacker, and they will begin to chase, as well as fight back against their attacker until one of them dies.<br>It is possible for a neutral mob to fight another mob that would typically not attack them. This is commonly caused when an arrow, shot by a Skeleton, accidentally hits another mob while the skeleton is trying to hit a player.<br>Certain mobs may be neutral in some situations, and hostile in others. One example of this is the Polar Bear. An adult polar bear can be neutral, but it becomes hostile if one of their cubs is nearby a player or if it's attacked. The latter also applies to untamed Wolves, Llamas, dolphins, and aggressive Pandas.</p>
