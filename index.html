    <p> Minecraft is a blocky sandbox game where players explore a procedurally generated, three-dimensional world with virtually infinite terrain. Players can discover and extract raw materials, craft tools and items, and build structures, earthworks, and machines. The game is made up of blocks, creatures, and community. Players can choose to survive the night or build a work of art.</p>
    <h1 id="entities">Entities</h1>
    <p>In Minecraft, entities are living creatures that move around in the game. They have properties such as position, rotation, velocity, volume, and the ability to be on fire or have status effects. Some entities, like armor stands or paintings, are items with data tags that can be modified.</p>
